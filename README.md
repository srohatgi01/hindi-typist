# TypeHindi

## Introduction

TypeHindi is an innovative typing tutor inspired by Monkeytype and Typing Club, designed specifically for those who wish to learn to type in Hindi. This project is a modern, user-friendly tool aimed at making the learning process both efficient and enjoyable.

## Motivation


Why create another typing tool when several already exist? Here are a few reasons why TypeHindi stands out:

- Modern Interface: Many existing tools haven't been updated in years, giving a dated feel. TypeHindi brings a fresh, contemporary interface to enhance the user experience.
- Focus on Learning: Unlike tools that are primarily for practice, TypeHindi emphasizes teaching the fundamentals of typing in Hindi, making it ideal for beginners.
- Resource for Students: Students preparing for government jobs often learn typing at Typing Hubs, which may not provide comprehensive education on the 'whats' and 'hows' of Hindi typing. TypeHindi aims to fill this gap.

## Fun Facts

Despite the Indian Government standardizing a particular Hindi keyboard layout, the Remington Hindi Keyboard layout remains more popular.
InScript (Indian Script) supports 12 different scripts, including Devanagri.
Many government typing exams still utilize the Remington keyboard layout for the Devanagri script.

## Project Status

The boilerplate for the typing engine is now complete.
